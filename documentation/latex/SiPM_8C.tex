class \mbox{\hyperlink{classSiPM}{Si\+PM}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class stores information from the \mbox{\hyperlink{classSiPM}{Si\+PM}} used while processing acquired data. It have some important features such as convert channel\+ID into an index for rows and columns, or into the position of the event in mm, in this case the zero is located in the center of the crystal array. ~\newline
 In the case of segmented crystals the position represents the center of the crystal element. ~\newline
 Other options such as micro\+Cells have been added for future works. ~\newline
 This class have hard coded the positions of the channels in a matrix using as reference the Ketek Pa 3325 wb 0808 channels disposition ~\newline
 It also have implemented a method for converting the crystal\+ID from a gate acquisition into a i,j index that represents the position in a mxn matrix. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
